<p>It&rsquo;s only Tuesday&hellip; and already it&rsquo;s been a crazy as all hell week. Not entirely sure why&hellip; but I suppose having upgrades of Epic over the weekend at the office didn&rsquo;t help things. Working in healthcare in the IS department certainly does have its share of interesting and random encounters. Also&hellip; so does being the only one seemingly present on site on a Sunday when it seems that you were the only one who responded to a call for coverage. I could be incorrect about that, though, but it does feel like I was alone.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-start-with-the-basics">Let&rsquo;s start With The Basics</h2>

<p>Today, as Tuesdays go, was fairly normal. Got in on time&hellip; after accidentally waking up at 06:10, but that&rsquo;s beside the point. Driver came to pick me up in a reasonable time, which is nice, because traffic sucked on the way in, and I still managed to pick up my coffee and a pastry with time to spare. I can&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;        s the way of it every day, though.  And&hellip; it&rsquo;s only a little afternoon. We&rsquo;ll have to see how the rest of the day goes.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<pre><code>I will admit... when any of the vaccines first came out, I had a seriously different outlook on them than I do now after getting my first Pfizer shot back on August 25th. While I don't agree with the way the media is portraying the vaccine, and I seriously sometimes wonder about the truth of a lot of the information we've been provided, I have to say... I agree with the incentive to be vaccinated. (in fact, I should have gone with rather than against my gut when it told me to vaccinate immediately. Instead, I waited for my family to make the move first.)

## Pfizer Adventures

On August 25th, as stated above, I ended up getting my first shot. While others have had negative reactions towards it... mine went pretty smoothly. Nothing but a bit of a muscle ache afterwards... will be fun ggetting the second one, for that seems to be the one that's not as smooth. (I hope that my body doesn't play tricks on me during that time.) I will be keeping you updated; next entry on this will be the 15th of September, when my appointment is scheduled. 

The biggest pile of advice I can give you? Keep the noise and Bullshit about this stuff out of your life; whether that's via social media, television, and so on. Focus on the facts, not the potential fictions surrounding them; I think that if I had taken my own advice and done this, then I wouldn't have waited as long, I would not have believed falsely the way that I did at first.  Either way, good luck, and keep an eye on your health.

<pre><code>## Updates
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a bit since I have done a longer post&hellip; so, it&rsquo;s about time that gets fixed. Here we go&hellip; Firstly, happy friday, everyone. At this point, I am going to give a quick overview of what I&rsquo;ve been working on. That&rsquo;s not too much at the moment, though, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, but at least I do have some milestones to report&hellip; at least that&rsquo;s something.</p>

<h2 id="first-programming">First&hellip; Programming</h2>

<p>I aim for the following goals for the rest of the year&hellip; that is, provided I can remain undistracted enough to finish in a timely manner.</p>

<ul>
<li>Obtain a working knowledge of the C# language</li>
<li>Be able to use APIs to create things lacking in the windows world</li>
<li>Proceed with my existing PowerShell studies</li>
<li>Be able to make decisions regarding the correct tool for the application</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go further with these goals in mind&hellip; though in light of it being only about five months away give or take, my next set of ideas will probably take me into 2022, and it&rsquo;s about time we finish up 2021 first. I definitely have some challenges ahead of me&hellip; that&rsquo;s for dang sure.</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p>One thing is true&hellip; and that&rsquo;s the fact I have let my music skills languish in disuse for far too long. (I am hoping that when I move&hellip; I will be recording a heck of a lot more audio tracks thanks to my friend&rsquo;s digital piano; as gorgeous as acoustic instruments are; have one, and I love her, they are very difficult to work with on the side of the amateur audio engineer) which will be nice for those interested, and more people are than I would have thought possible. I have some goals to fulfill by the end of the year&hellip; hopefully.</p>

<ol>
<li>restore my past numbers.</li>
<li>Learn something new</li>
<li>complete some of my previously unfinished complsitions</li>
</ol>

<p>Either way&hellip; until next time, have a great time, everyone.</p>

<h2 id="weekend-craziness">Weekend Craziness</h2>

<p>As I arrive at my desk on this fairly gray Monday morning here in the beautiful city of Somerville, I recall how important wonderful time spent with family and friends is, and how essential those sorts of relationships are to the average person. Not just for them, but for everyone currently living, to be honest. And then to find that someone whom you have known for about eleven years, when she has already discussed her dream to move out of state. How do connections survive that sort of thing?</p>

<pre><code>### How I will Survive

Well, that's a hard one. Knowing that my friend will more than likely be moving to the mid west, in CA, of course, that being her dream, she was simply waiting for an opportunity to pop up. Knowing that I will see her after a while, and that she will eventually find a schedule/routine to get her ass back up here every once in a while ... that's good enough for me. Spiritually based connections don't ormally brak over distances.
